#always remember the order of operations.. Parenthesis, exponents, multiply, divide, add, subtract!

# 2 minus 10 = -8
2 - 10

# 3 time 5 = 15
3 * 5

# 9 divided by 2
9 / 2

# Be careful! 3 and 2 are multiplied first in this equation. Thus the answer is -1 after 6 is subtracted from 5
5 - 3 * 2

#If you want to subtract values first then put them in parenthesis before you multiply by 2
(5 - 3) * 2

# Ahhh, gotta love quick and easy square root code **
4 ** 2

# Don't forget exponents happen first before division. so here it is really 8/4 because 2 **2= 4 
8 / 2 ** 2
